= JavaWebMail

WTF? Another web mail client? Why?

This is meant to be the world's _most minimal mail messager_ for Java EE Web.
It only intends to:

. display a list of messages;
. view the text of a given message;
. reply to a message;
. compose a new message.

No attachments. No mailing lists or address book. Just the absolute bare bones.

Why? So it has few dependencies and is easy to install and maintain, that's why.
Because it's all I need - I mostly read email with IMAP, but sometimes have to
work behind crazy firewalls where only HTTP is permitted. So I need to be able
to peep at my messages, but that's all.
